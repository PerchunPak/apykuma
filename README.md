Small library to notify Uptime Kuma that the service is up.
Only async applications are supported.

## Usage

Firstly, install the library:

```bash
pip install apykuma
```

Then include it in your code:

```python
import logging
import apykuma

await apykuma.start(
    # Required; Push URL from Kuma GUI
    url="https://my-service.com",
    # Optional; default is 60 seconds
    interval=60,
    # Optional; sleeps for N seconds before pinging Kuma, in case if you run `apykuma` right before starting your service
    #           (if service fails, `apykuma` won't start as well). The recommended value is 10 seconds
    delay=0,
    # Optional; function that is called when during ping we encourage an error
    #           it is done to notify you about (e.g.) network errors, and to not
    #           stop the process of pinging kuma on such errors
    #
    #           by default, it logs an error using `logging` library (default value is shown below),
    #           also supports async functions
    handle_exception=lambda e: logging.getLogger("apykuma").exception(e),
)
```

It is important to start `apykuma` after your service starts.

## Differences from `pykuma`

https://github.com/oliverstech/pykuma

That library is great, but it has some problems:

- It uses globals, which I personally don't like
- It blocks the loop every time it sends a request, because it uses `requests` library instead of `aiohttp`. See also https://github.com/oliverstech/pykuma/issues/2.

## Installing for local developing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerchunPak/apykuma.git
cd apykuma
```

### Installing `poetry`

Next we need install `poetry` with [recommended way](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation).

If you use Linux, use command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
```

If you use Windows, open PowerShell with admin privileges and use:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

### Installing dependencies

```bash
poetry install --no-dev
```

### Configuration

All configuration happens in `config.yml`, or with enviroment variables.

### If something is not clear

You can always write me!
